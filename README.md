## 1. Create a virtual environment

Using Python 3 (macOS comes with it):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This will create a `venv/` directory with an isolated Python environment.

---

## 2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You’ll see the terminal prompt change, showing `(venv)` — that means the virtual environment is active.

## 3. Install dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Run the Python script

```bash
python your_script.py
```
