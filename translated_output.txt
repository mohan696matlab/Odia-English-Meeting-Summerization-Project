I thought that I would become the chief minister and sit in the chief minister's chair. I thought that if there is a government for 25-30 years, it will not do any special work. Because of the super chief minister, the government failed to serve the people. You are not a victim of any attack. The government, in a planned manner, to kill me, to murder me, threw a bomb at my car. There is a great responsibility to correct it. In this, mafia will not work, goons will not work. Will you forgive me or take action? Today I am the Chief Minister. If you give punishment, I can give whatever I want. I will forgive you. From the first day, you are in action mode. The Chief Minister himself is going. Why is the secretary not going? Why are the officers not going? Mohan Majhi, People's Chief Minister. Mohan Majhi will be the People's Chief Minister. Not only in the capital of Bhubaneswar, but also reaching every village. There is an allegation that some In this way, there is a lot of loot. This will not leave our government in the coming days. How is Mohan Charan Majhi different from Naveen Patnaik? Naveen Babu was born in a political family. My father worked as a peon in an ordinary family. All the journalists want that within their lifetime, they should take the reaction of the Chief Minister. They should sit with him and discuss or interview him. We are very happy. We are very happy to meet you. Because Naveen Patnaik was the Chief Minister and he was a great leader. How can we reach the journalists? But the oath is not over, only three days are left. Within three days, we have the Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri Mohan Saran Majhi, for discussion. He has also given us time. Welcome. Congratulations to Vijay and the reaction. I want to thank you for giving your time. We are grateful to you. Life has suddenly changed. Within a few days, the responsibility of the Chief Minister has changed suddenly. The government's running and the main responsibility of the whole of Odisha is today. This is not just a miracle. This is the result of my struggle. I am fighting for the people, doing politics, creating organizations for service and wherever organizations are created, Power is created. When power is created, then power is created. And when power is created, then definitely, the government's running is also a responsibility. This is my very big experience and this is definitely possible. For my 4.5 crore Odia people, for my Lord, Mahaprabhu Jagannath. Sir, did you ever think that I would become the Chief Minister, that I would sit in the Chief Minister's seat? I thought so. Definitely, such a time will come. I I have a great responsibility. And for that, it's not easy or by luck that I get it. Therefore, I have to work. And for that, I was busy with my work. And my self-confidence gradually increased. That yes, I can. The ability has come, along with the responsibility. The responsibility of ruling Odisha. Within the last 24 years, the situation of Odisha has reached such a level that there are no teachers in schools, no doctors in hospitals, there are no young people in the villages to work No, no. The 24 years of disorder, how to start the responsibility to improve it within 5 years? This is a big challenge for me today. Today, my government and our government will start efforts to achieve overall development within 5 years. We have also given this resolution. And doing work for 50 years in 5 years is a very difficult task. But today, the confidence that success can be achieved is born in my life. Therefore, I am optimistic today that the new government is addressing various problems today in a full-fledged manner. As you said, the teacher's words, the doctor's words, are being said. Generally speaking, there is another big problem from that, which is that the previous government, within 24 years, could not provide clean water to the common people. This is also a challenge. You have been a former MLA three times. If a government remains for a long time, 25 years, 30 years, if a government remains, it does not do any special work. There was such an experience that the government should make the people self-reliant. It should empower them. Without doing that, the government itself became empowered and every leader and officer of the government, the chief minister who was there before me, because of the super chief minister above him, in which the people The government failed to provide services. The previous government was not ready to listen to the criticism. It was retaliatory. If any journalist raised any questions, action was taken against them, or if anyone wrote any columns, action was taken against them. You were the chief whip of the opposition party. You were criticizing without any reason. You are not a victim of any attack. In the assembly, as I am a member, the government is attacked. The government is injured. But it is also retaliatory. And when In the district and state, many times, many things have happened in front of the government. The government, in a planned manner, tried to kill me. To kill me, they threw bombs on my vehicle. They threw two bombs two years ago to kill me. Mohan Majhi is trying to corner the government. He is trying to open a trap for the government. He will kill me. He will not leave the legislators to attack. This is the truth. In the Gandhamardan mine area, three panchayats were not given to you. A young man named Raja was committing crimes there. Even the elected MLA could not go to that place. I am saying this because the law and order situation in the entire state is adverse today. It is a great responsibility to improve it. I have the courage today to give justice to the people. When I was not in the government, I was struggling to give justice to the people. Today, while struggling, I have taken the main responsibility I will give justice to that area, I will free it from the clutches of goons and mafia dons. There is no problem in this matter today. And if the government remains in action mode, then it can definitely be protected and for that, whatever is needed, I am certain that my government will take responsibility. In this, mafia rule will not continue, goons will not continue, looting of poor people will not continue, people will get justice. The police are at the ground level. But at Kendujhar Sadar Police Station, there are officers like the IIC named Trinath Sethi.  They will show the MLA (presumably a person or organization) their thumbprint and threaten him. Then how will justice be served? Will you forgive Trinath Sethi or take action? He was threatening me under the influence of the mafia don and got me out of the police station. If I take action against him today, it will cause me trouble and it is not the right way. A guilty person is not only punished but also forgives. If I punish him today, I can get whatever I want, but I won't gain much from it. I am not happy. If you forgive me, then definitely I will be very happy. In the coming days, those who knowingly or unknowingly commit some mistakes and do not perform their duties properly, then at least they will get this lesson. But I want to give this message that do not consider the person in front of you as completely ignorant. No one knows who will be where and when in the cycle of time. This is the cycle of time and those who are suffering in it. You are asking me, before, I have met many people, sat with them, some even abused me, some didn't even give me permission to go anywhere. But in the next moment, I am becoming the Chief Minister. Such a situation will definitely come, as before the storm, peace.  Regarding Mohan Majhi, in his area, in Kendujhar Sadar, a matter was discussed. He is not our leader, he is our brother. Everyone addresses Mohan as brother. And this matter is also discussed. From the 21st of the month of August to the cremation ground, they stand there personally. And for this, you are popular. But the responsibility of the constituency was there, now the responsibility of the whole state.  The work that could be done in their constituency, that will not be done. For this, some information is coming.  The effort to go to everyone's house was there, at that time, as an ordinary MLA, as a minister, the Chief Minister's work was definitely there.  The whole of I have considered the alternative. Even if I cannot reach, how will the Chief Minister reach? By giving a message, by representing someone, and by giving them full respect. Then the experience will be that the Chief Minister is in Bhubaneswar. But today I got a message. Definitely my work is done. I can do this work. And for that, I have completely planned and prepared my plan. You must have seen the hero. He was the chief minister for a day and was managing all the arrangements. Similarly, we see that from the first day, you are in action mode. Sometimes you suddenly reach the settlement, sometimes you reach the birthplace of Gopabandhu, sometimes you reach the Kuni Jheti. Actually, this work is done in the initial stages, not until the end, the campaign will continue. See, loving and serving people is the vow of my life. Before serving, going to them, seeing You will see that for five years, I will definitely not only be in Bhubaneswar capital, but I will reach every village and will give justice to the people. Within a few days, there will be a matter for everyone that Mohan Majhi will be the People's Chief Minister. Definitely, Mohan Majhi will be the People's Chief Minister. I am not just saying this, I will definitely do the work. You were busy with office work.  I heard that you returned home at 1:30 AM last night. So, how many days will it take to return at 1:30 AM? How long will the body remain weak?  I will definitely relax the body. It is necessary to give it rest. I have to give more time to new things, and since such a big responsibility comes suddenly in my life, I will handle this responsibility immediately. But since I have a long experience of working hard, I will work hard and get results in it. I will definitely pay attention to keeping my body healthy, but when the responsibility comes, I will work all night. I am confident that I will be able to work with full enthusiasm. And when a Chief Minister, his entire family, his entire family, how much neglect he shows towards his own family. I have neglected my family a lot before. You will be surprised. My younger son was a small child, two and a half years old, almost two years old. One day, I came to Bhubaneswar from Kendujhar, my family lives in Bhubaneswar, in a big house. My wife took him and brought him here. I couldn't understand what you were saying. He didn't know that this was my father. I was asked a question that day when I came from Kendujhar to Bhubaneswar. I was so busy with various party work in Bhubaneswar that I couldn't meet the children. That day, he said to me, 'Okay, father, don't you ever get office leave?' That question was in my mind. The first day I became the Chief Minister, I was actually staying in a guest house, a state guest house. But I didn't sleep even for a day. Even at night, I went home. It is true, but they are sleeping. There is a need to stay with the family. They want to reach happiness and peace. Staying with them is very less. Raja is going on. Many people are coming to meet you with flowers. The Sathya Samiti Sahana Mela is going on. Everyone is going to the Chief Minister's office. They are giving flowers, taking selfies. How are you opening up? This is also my job. You were saying some time ago that there was a film called 'Nayak'. I have seen the film 'Nayak' many times. I have seen Anil Kapoor's role in it. There is no difficulty in giving it reality, and it has a lot of inspiration. Today, I feel that the character of 'Nayak' and the story of that film, even a Chief Minister can do that work in the same way and provide justice to people. Sir, some BJD supporters on social media are saying that they have lost and they cannot accept defeat easily. They have been in power for 24 years. They are writing something that to get gold, they went to Odisha and lost diamonds. Maybe they want to show you gold and Naveen Patnaik as diamonds. Do you want to be in the comparison of gold and diamonds? The children of Utkal Mata and this sacred land of Odisha, this is my mother. I love that land and I want that sacred land, but I don't want gold or diamonds. Those who are accused of looting Odisha's property, those who are accused of stealing property from Tamil Nadu, all these investigations will be conducted and those who are guilty will be punished. Those who have looted Odisha, those who have created a mafia don here, have completely tried to weaken Odisha's economy today. They will not be forgiven by our government.  An inquiry will be conducted at the appropriate time, and the guilty will be punished. The guilty will be from Tamil Nadu, or any other state, or even within Odisha. The guilty will be punished, and their property will be returned to the state of Odisha. The election is happening, your personal assistant is missing. Two incidents, brother's disappearance, health services are affected and assistant's disappearance, road accident is affected. As the Chief Minister, these two things have made you more agitated. Therefore, how can our health services be improved more, how can people's lives be saved from road accidents, focus on these two. One of my own younger brothers was declared cancerous after the election, he was treated, but during the treatment, he went to the road and died in a road accident. Exactly now, one of my assistants, one of my employees, he is my own brother and this assistant, they are equal to each other, he also liked it very much, his younger brother was good, so the law will be made stricter. The central government is working on this issue and has a major role in this accident.  Our government is emphasizing this. Now, one government at the center and another in the state, after a long time, Odisha has been formed. Therefore, development will be accelerated.  There will be more coordination between the state and the center and the union system. Definitely, see, a double engine government has been formed. The Modi government has guaranteed that the development of Odisha will be completed within 50 years by doing the work of 50 years. This I am confident that I will be able to do it. Two Deputy Chief Ministers, after a long time, I am seeing the Deputy Chief Minister of Odisha. Basanta Vishwal and Ananda Vishwal, after them, I don't know, in the government. Therefore, your work will be expedited. The work will be decentralized. The government will go to that level. The Chief Minister cannot reach anywhere, nor can the Deputy Chief Minister. You will be able to, some ministers will be there. To expedite this work, decentralize the power and by giving the Deputy Chief Minister's responsibility to the people, further make the governance dynamic and people-oriented. This will definitely be evaluated in the coming days. You will know how the governance is going down and how it will be very helpful in the path of people's development. But when only Naveen's side or Pandian's side had the power, it was a little bit. And you The central government is working as a team to make the governance system easier and simpler. The Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, and Ministers are not working properly in Odisha. The administrative authorities are not running the government properly. Therefore, people are saying that this is a dictatorial government. In a democratic government, the people's representatives, the people's representatives, the real governance, the main thing is that the people's feelings and feelings, the village, their own region, geographical conditions, and if they don't speak themselves, then in If we never forget, we will return after giving a speech at a place in the district headquarters stadium. We can see the real picture. Whether it is the Chief Minister, the ministers, or our Deputy Chief Minister, they can go towards reality and report to the government, and the government will take appropriate steps at the right time. This is our true ideology, our true mission. By holding on to this mission, we will go down and definitely help the people and develop. You started your career as a guru in a children's home. Currently, we are surveying and seeing the poor state of the education system. My government has given 5T in schools. But the quality of education has not improved. We see that children aged 15 to 18 cannot do second-grade mathematics. Children studying in eighth grade cannot read a second-grade book of literature. So, the education system of the past few years The situation has been brought to such a state that improving it is a very big challenge. If there had been a transformation, then today there would have been a history. But painting the broken walls, where there are no roofs, only tiles, painting those tiles, doing various works artificially, meaning bringing grass and weeds and leveling them. The work that has been done, in reality, has not developed today. There has been a loot here, and in the coming days, our government will not leave it, but you will be surprised to know that in Kendujhar district, nearly 450 schools have been converted, and in each of those schools, ₹2,50,00,000 have been spent on painting programs, and in some places, repairs have been done, and in some places, small buildings have been constructed. He said that the money is finished, how did it happen? And a definite inquiry will be made on that. 62,000 teachers are still on vacations today, only up to high school. And to fill their vacancies, the government failed. Why? Because they couldn't get a surplus budget. If 62,000 teachers are appointed, how much salary will they get? 2.5 lakh vacant posts are there. If we appoint them and make their salaries and other arrangements, how much will it cost? The government hid this matter. We are attacking the government. And for that, today we have to give its reality. Gradually, the appointments that our government is talking about, starting from the appointment of teachers, every department will be appointed. When in 2000, you became an MLA for the first time, when you came to the assembly for the first time, at that time Draupadi Murmu, she came as an MLA for the first time. Dharmendra Pradhan came as an MLA for the first time. How do you remember that day How do you remember the year 2000? You are going to the big stage. When you remember this, this history makes you very happy, very joyful. The tribal community, those who have been discriminated against as Dalits for hundreds of years, we see a tribal Chief Minister, we see a tribal President. In reality, the neglect towards this community or this tribe has come a long time ago. The transformation of governance is reflected in India. Until then, in the coming days, I think that whatever model is coming or our ideology is coming, if we can be realistic, then we can definitely make Odisha a golden Odisha or a new Odisha. During the previous government's time, the capital of Odisha was looted. Do you have any apprehension about this? This matter has been said many times that it has been looted. Those who are guilty or those who have committed looting or those who have committed dacoity, our government will not spare We will definitely bring back the wealth and property. Sir, there is a trend on social media that the hoardings of 5T in the state, the hoardings of Naveen Patnaik, will be removed by the government. That is, how much the government was advertising itself, what will it say? The government was far from reality. Because through advertisements, they wanted to give a real form and covered the whole state with hoardings. But the hoardings are not there. If the government is far from reality, We will not let the government go far. Therefore, the government is aware of this and is careful. Definitely, we will do the real work of giving justice to the people in the political system and the people. We are going to take a mission. Therefore, we will take necessary steps and think about the hoarding. The government has lost power. The previous government will face more retaliation and violence. There are more MLAs who are strongly opposed. The government will be in the assembly. We will try our best to do this work. We will not call the opposition to come and prepare Odisha. Including everyone is our ideology. Therefore, we will also call the opposition parties and give good suggestions to the government. Giving good suggestions to the government, doing constructive work, this matter will definitely be called by the government. Therefore, Odisha's development will not happen by leaving the opposition. This is the real thing. But the opposition is strong today. The stronger the opposition, the more the government will work and show its preparedness. You will be careful and more effective. Sir, I want an answer to that question. How is Mohan Charan Majhi different from Naveen Patnaik and in which areas is he different? I will not go into the comparison of Mohan Majhi with Naveen Babu. Naveen Babu, he was born in a political family. My father was a peon in an ordinary family. I have come from a simple family. I have never seen him in comparison. I will not do it. Sir, how did you find our podcast? It was very good. The way you asked questions, it gave me a lot of inspiration. In the coming days, I will work with the government with firm determination and will work with more enthusiasm. It gave me a lot of inspiration. For that, I thank the podcast.
